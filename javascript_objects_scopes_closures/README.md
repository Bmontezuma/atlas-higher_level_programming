## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to create an object in JavaScript
- What `this` means
- What `undefined` means
- Why the variable type and scope are important
- What is a closure
- What is a prototype
- How to inherit an object from another

## Requirements

- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: [AirBnB style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- You are not allowed to use `var`

### More Info

```bash
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs


Install semi-standard

bash
Copy code
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
rust
Copy code

This README provides information on advanced JavaScript concepts and resources for learning them. It also outlines the learning objectives and project requirements. Additionally, it includes instructions for installing Node.js and the semi-standard package.
