## ***Learning Objectives***
*At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:*

### ***General***
  
  - ***Why JavaScript programming is amazing:*** 
  *`JavaScript is amazing because it is a versatile and powerful programming language that can be used for both client-side and server-side development. It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.`*
  
  - ***How to create an object in JavaScript:*** 
  *`In JavaScript, you can create an object using object literal notation ***`{}`***, constructor functions, or the ***`class`*** keyword introduced in ECMAScript 6.`*
  
  - ***What ***`this`*** means:*** 
  *`In JavaScript, the `this` keyword refers to the object that is currently executing the code. Its value depends on how a function is called.`*

  - ***What ***`undefined`*** means:*** 
  *`In JavaScript, undefined represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value, or a function that does not return anything.`*
  
  - ***Why variable type and scope is important:*** 
  *`Understanding variable type and scope is crucial for writing robust and maintainable code. Variable type determines the kind of data that can be stored in a variable, while scope defines where in the code a variable is accessible.`*
  
  - ***What is a closure:*** 
  *`A closure is a feature in JavaScript where a function retains access to its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures are commonly used to create private variables and encapsulate functionality.`*
  
  - ***What is a prototype:*** 
  *`In JavaScript, every object has a prototype, which is an object from which it inherits properties and methods. Prototypes are used to implement inheritance and share behavior between objects.`*
  
  - ***How to inherit an object from another:*** 
  *`In JavaScript, you can inherit from another object using prototype chaining, constructor functions, or the class syntax provided by ECMAScript 6.`*
  


## ***Requirements***
### ***General***
- *Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs*
- *All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)*
- *All your files should end with a new line*
- *The first line of all your files should be exactly* ***`#!/usr/bin/node`***
- *A ***`README.md`*** file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory*
- *Your code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: ***[AirBnB style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)****
- *All your files must be executable*
- *The length of your files will be tested using* ***`wc`***
- *You are not allowed to use* ***`var`***

### ***More Info***

```
$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
$ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

***Install semi-standard***
```
bash
Copy code
$ sudo npm install semistandard --global
rust
Copy code
```
