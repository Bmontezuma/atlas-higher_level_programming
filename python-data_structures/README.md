# Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General

# General

## Lists

- Lists in programming are ordered collections of items. They are mutable, meaning you can change their content.
  
## Differences and Similarities between Strings and Lists

- Strings and lists share some similarities, such as being ordered sequences, but they have key differences. Strings are immutable, while lists are mutable.

## Common Methods of Lists

- Explore various methods available for lists, such as `append()`, `extend()`, `remove()`, and more.

## Lists as Stacks and Queues

- Learn how to use lists as stacks (Last In, First Out) and queues (First In, First Out).

## List Comprehensions

- Understand and use list comprehensions, a concise way to create lists.

## Tuples

- Tuples are similar to lists but immutable. Explore their properties and use cases.

## Tuples versus Lists

- Understand when to use tuples and when to use lists based on their characteristics.

## Sequence

- Learn about the concept of sequences in programming.

## Tuple Packing

- Understand the concept of tuple packing, where multiple items are packed into a single tuple.

## Sequence Unpacking

- Explore sequence unpacking, a way to extract individual items from a sequence.

## Del Statement

- Learn about the `del` statement and how to use it to delete items from lists or variables.

# Requirements

# Python Scripts

### Allowed Editors

- vi
- vim
- emacs

### Interpretation/Compilation

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).

### File Endings

- All your files should end with a new line.

### First Line

- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

### README.md

- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.

### Code Style

### Executability

- All your files must be executable.

### File Length

- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
