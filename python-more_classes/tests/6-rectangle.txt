Rectangle Class
===============

This module contains the Rectangle class, which represents a rectangle with specified width and height.

Usage
-----

1. Import the Rectangle class:

    ```python
    from 6-rectangle import Rectangle
    ```

2. Create instances of Rectangle and check the number of instances:

    ```python
    # Create rectangles
    r1 = Rectangle(2, 4)
    r2 = Rectangle(2, 4)

    # Check the number of instances
    Rectangle.number_of_instances
    ```
    Expected Output:
    ```
    2
    ```

3. Delete instances and check the number of instances:

    ```python
    # Delete one instance
    del r1

    # Check the number of instances
    Rectangle.number_of_instances
    ```
    Expected Output:
    ```
    1
    ```

    ```python
    # Delete the remaining instance
    del r2

    # Check the number of instances
    Rectangle.number_of_instances
    ```
    Expected Output:
    ```
    0
    ```

4. Additional doctests for class methods:

    ```python
    # Create a rectangle
    r = Rectangle(3, 4)

    # Calculate area
    r.area()
    ```
    Expected Output:
    ```
    12
    ```

    ```python
    # Calculate perimeter
    r.perimeter()
    ```
    Expected Output:
    ```
    14
    ```

    ```python
    # Print the string representation of the rectangle
    print(r)
    ```
    Expected Output:
    ```
    ###
    ###
    ###
    ###
    ```

    ```python
    # Get a string representation for eval()
    repr(r)
    ```
    Expected Output:
    ```
    'Rectangle(3, 4)'
    ```

    ```python
    # Delete the instance
    del r
    ```
    Expected Output:
    ```
    Bye rectangle...
    ```
